# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Let‚Äôs return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable.

        Comments on accessibility, reproducibility and equitability for Data visualisation 1: ‚ÄúEuro 2024 Analyzer‚Äù
        
        
        
        1.	The use of red and green colors in the visualisation makes it inaccessible to people with certain type of color blindness eg deuteranopia (red-green colorblindness) or achromatopsia (partial or total lack of color vision). 
        2.	There is a lack of alternative descriptive text which means that people using screen readers cannot access the data described in the visualisation. There might be a lot of Euro football fans who would like to access the data but are either visually impaired or so might be excluded from the possible audience for this visualisation. 
        3.	The brightness and contrast in the picture is good so people on the autism spectrum will not find it overly stimulating which is a positive attribute of the visualisation. 
        4.	The visualisation is easy to follow and provides clear and concise information for its readers. 
        5.	The visualisation is equitable as it seems fair and right to all the teams mention in the data and does not show any biases in terms of gender etc.. The data visualisation considers diversity and does not disproportionately exclude or misrepresent certain groups. 


        Comments on accessibility, reproducibility and equitability for Data visualisation 2: ‚ÄúFriends in low places
        
        1.	The poor choice of colors and contrast makes the image overly stimulating and not suitable for individuals with visual impairments making it a bad choice in terms of accessibility.
        2.	 Overly bright colors can be painful to look at and overwhelming for people with sensory issues and people on the autism spectrum. 
        3.	The data visualisation lacks reproducibility as it lacks clear documentation and processing steps to replicate the same visualisation in the future. 
        4.	The visualisation seems to be doing fine in terms of equity as it is allowing fair representation and impact for all audiences. 
        
        


        ```
     - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        Your answer...
        Improvements for data visualisation 1:

        1.	Colors in the visualisation could be updated to include audiences with different visual impairments. Color Blindness Simulator can be used to check for the how the colors are perceived by people with various types of colorblindness 
        2.	Alternative descriptive texts could be included under each interactive image to make the data visualisation accessible to people using a screen reader or those who are unable to see the image. 
        3.	To make the data visualisation reproducible, a detailed documentation of the data sources, analysis methods, code, configurations, and any assumptions made during the analysis can be provided.
        4.	The visualisation could include mention of ‚Äòunderwater labour‚Äô so that people who contributed to the making of the visualisation could be honoured for their work. 
        
        
        Improvements for data visualisation 2:

        1.	Good choice of colors to be perceived well with people with visual impairments.
        2.	Alternative descriptive texts could be added.
        3.	Color blindness simulator and WebAIM can be used to check for contrast between two colors
        4.	Use high contrast colors and legible fonts. Additionally avoid solely relying on colors to convey information and incorporate text labels and descriptions for important elements. 
        5.	Provode descriptive text for figure so that the screen readers can convey information to visually impaired users. 
        6.	Clear documentation should be provided on the data sources, preprocessing steps and visualisation techniques. the code used to generate the visualisation should be shared to allow for the image to be reproduced easily.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization.
