# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      Your answer...

      Good visualisation:
      ‚ÄúEuro 2024 Analyzer‚Äù
      link:
      https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nick.van.lieshout/viz/Euro2024AnalyzerAllPost-GameReports/GameSummary

      Aesthetics:
      The visualisation clearly depicts the summary of the game played between two playing teams with clearly labelled diagrams and their explanations, optimal use of distinct colors and easy to follow information. The colors and balanced use of image and text makes the visualisation pleasing to look at. Distinct and catchy colors are used for example in the match summary of the match between Denmark and England, red and blue are used to represent each team respectively.  Therefore, the visualisation scores nicely on the aesthetics parameter that determines the quality of the data visualisation.  
      
      Substantive:
      This parameter accesses whether the visualisation accurately and honestly presents the data. 
      The summary of each game is accurately represented in the visualisation so that the reader can clearly follow the match summary, passing deep-dive details and shooting deep-dive details etc. Furthermore, the match summary is very clear and explicitly shares the possession, field tilt, shots etc between the two teams so the user can easily ascertain which team played better. For example, between the match of Denmark and England, the score is clearly mentioned at the top i.e. 1-1 so we know that the match was a tie. Further studying the match reveals that Denmark had 51% possession of the ball, had a higher field tilt of 61% and 16 shots compared to England. 
      
      Perceptual:
      Even for someone who isn‚Äôt familiar with football to a great length can easily study the figure and study the relationship between the performance of the two teams. The user can easily follow through the figure and can switch to any match between two respective teams so analyze it further. The message of the maker of the visualisation is clear and concise. 
      


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
      
      Some of the abbreviations of the terms are not clear like xG, xA, G and A. Therefore, a key with an explanation of these acronyms should have made the analysis even better. The figure of the match field in the match summary showing the various players numbers can be labelled in a better fashion to know what the football sign and the yellow rectangle depicts. 

      Bad visualisation:

      ‚ÄúFriends in low places:
      link:
      https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/whitney6892/viz/FriendsinLowPlaces/Brooks

      Aesthetic:
      The visualisation portrays Garth Brooks‚Äô song ‚ÄòFriends in Low Places‚Äô by various instruments  from a Midi file ranging from piano, acoustic guitar, percussion, steel guitar, electrical bass, electric guitar. The visualisation is a bad example of data visualisation as its is not aesthetically pleasing to look at due to the very dark black background and very colorful and bold concentric circles on top of it. The black background with the colorful circles actually give a headache if stared at for a very long time if one is trying to figure out what the visualisation shows.  This data visualisation is confusing and cluttered and it fails to communicate the intended message of the musical instruments used in the song ‚Äòfriends in low places‚Äô. Too many data points with varying sizes and frequency are overwhelming for the audience. 
      
      Substantive:
      It is unclear if the ‚Äòstart‚Äô and ‚Äòend‚Äô denotes the start and end of the song or something else? The labels of the y-axis and x-axis are missing so the data is not represented accurately and fails to explain the significance of the plots. When the curser is pointed on the circles, more information about the circles is displayed like notes, instrument, time, note-name, and length. However, it is unclear what the reader should make of this information and how this will help them the song. There is no clear story or focus as the visualisation fails to guide the viewer to understand the key insights of the data.
      
      Perceptual:
      
      The data is very confusing as one doesn‚Äôt understand what relationship the maker of the visualisation is trying to convey with the concentric circles, their size and exact location, and the overlapping. Does the size and relative position of the circles means the time that they occur in the song? Does the size of the circles demonstrate the frequency of the instrument used or not? Does the overlapping of the circles mean any significant conclusion like if the instruments are all used together. Lack of proper labels and titles or explanations makes the data hard to interpret and appreciate its significance. 
      
      Improvements:
      
      Good choice of colors, fonts and styles can make the visualisation easy to read so it is both aesthetically pleasing and perceptual. There should be proper labels, titles and explanations for the data which would add clarity and context in helping to interpret the data accurately. The data visualisation can be made less overwhelming and complicated by not adding too many data points which fail to tell a good story. Simplicity and focus often lead to better understanding.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
